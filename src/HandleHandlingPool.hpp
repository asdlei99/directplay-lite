/* This class maintains a pool of threads to wait on HANDLEs and invoke callback functors when the

 *
 * For up to every max_handles_per_pool HANDLEs registered, threads_per_pool worker threads will be
 * created to wait on them. Each block of HANDLEs will be assigned to their own pool of threads but
 * may move between them when handles are removed.
 *
 * Handles may be added or removed at any point, although this is not a heavily optimised path and
 * will temporarily block all worker threads from waiting on their handles.
 *
 * Note that the same callback may be invoked in multiple threads concurrently if the linked HANDLE
 * is signalled multiple times in quick sucession or is a manual reset event. Ensure your callbacks
 * can handle this and do not block, as this will prevent other HANDLEs managed by the same thread
 * from being invoked.

		 * 3) Set spin_workers to signalled
		 * 4) Exclusively lock wait_lock

		 * 8) Release pending_writer_lock
